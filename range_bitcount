You are given two numbers a and b where 0 ≤ a ≤ b. Imagine you construct an array of all the integers from a to b inclusive. You need to count the number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers in the array.

Example

For a = 2 and b = 7, the output should be
solution(a, b) = 11.


My solution

func solution(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    var tally = 0
    var x:String = ""
    for i in a...b{
        x = String(i, radix:2)
        tally += x.filter{ $0 == "1"}.count 
    }
return tally  

}
